# WebBrowser
Janky text-based web browser for XBMC4Xbox. This probably won't ever be very good.

## Working
- Visiting websites and viewing their text / images
- Clicking links to go to their respective pages
- Adding pages to favourites 

## Not Working
- Pages with lots of content (will crash the Xbox)
- Pagination
- Forms (so no logging into anything)
- Cookies (unlikely to ever happen)
- Downloads
- Most things, really.
